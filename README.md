**Report titled: Bayesian Multi-level Analysis on Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) Experiment in Tennessee**

The report uses the Student Teacher Achievement Ratio experiment in Tennessee to study the relationship between class sizes and students’ academic performance. The Tennessee STAR experiment is a large-scale randomized experiment in Tennessee to study the effect of smaller classes, costing $12 million. The study population was the cohort of kindergarteners in 1985–86, or about 11,600 children. Overall, the dataset in use contains 6325 observations of four variables. Each observation represents a kindergartener in one of the 80 schools in Tennessee, randomly assigned to a small class, a regular class, or a regular class with a full-time teacher aside. Their performance is gauged by their numeracy ability. The report conducts Bayesian machine learning analysis using competing methods at both the single and multi-levels to understand the effects of class size on students’ performance.
